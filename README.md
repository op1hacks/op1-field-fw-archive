## Missing files

There might be earlier or other firmware versions that aren't listed here but they're probably not publicly available anyway.
There might also be more recent firmware versions so be sure to check out the TE official downloads to find the latest firmware. You should get the latest firmware from them anyway, this list is mainly for archival purposes.
